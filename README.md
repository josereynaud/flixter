# What is Flixter?

This is a project for the University of Toronto where we build a two-sided video-streaming marketplace, featuring credit card payment capabilities, user role management, advanced UI and UX, and advanced database relationships, which is similar to other platforms like Udemy.

This was built using Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL as the database.
